                  You can also describe the format the class will take, for

                  will be recorded depending on in person or remote
                  learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you will be using technology, please indicate which
                  technologies you will use (e.g. Zoom, Google Meet, Google
                  Suite). For remote teaching clarify how the course will be
                  delivered (asynchronously vs synchronously) and which
                  tools will be used for each aspect of the course. You can
                  also note if lecture content will be live, pre-recorded or
                  if live sessions will be recorded depending on in person
                  or remote learning.

                  In cases where there are multiple sections of the same
                  course that share a common outline, students should be
                  provided with at least a brief instructor-specific
                  version.

              <p>
                At Toronto Metropolitan University, we recognize that things can come up throughout
                the term that may interfere with a studentâ€™s ability to
                succeed in their coursework. These circumstances are outside
                of oneâ€™s control and can have a serious impact on physical
                and mental well-being. Seeking help can be a challenge,
                especially in those times of crisis. Below are resources we
                encourage all Toronto Metropolitan University community members to access to ensure
                support is reachable.

    <div id="office-hours">
      <h2>Accessible office hours</h2>
      Include, if possible, the option to meet remotely via Google Hangouts or Zoom, or to schedule meetings at more
      flexible times using Google Calendar. Consider giving students the option of group office hours rather than
      individual meetings. Meeting virtually and in flexible time slots makes office hours more accessible to students
      who commute long distances, have family or work commitments, or disabilities that make it difficult for them to be
      on campus or meet at specific times. Group meetings can make office hours less intimidating to students who are
      shy, anxious, or struggling with the material. Learn how to use Google Calendar to create appointment slots for
      office hours: <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/google/teach-with-google-workspace/scheduling/">Teaching with

    <div id="equipment-use">
      <h2>Equipment use</h2>
      Consider telling your students why the textbook and or equipment/materials were selected and where they can be

      idea to state this as part of the Course Overview.
